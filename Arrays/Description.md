## Arrays
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type. </br>
Unlike lists, which can store elements of different types, arrays in Python are designed to store elements of a single type, which can make them more memory efficient and faster for certain operations.</br>

Arrays in Python are provided by the array module, which must be imported before use.</br>
The array module provides a class also called array, which can be used to create arrays with elements of a specific data type.</br>

Arrays in Python are commonly used when you need to work with a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type, such as numerical data.</br>
They are particularly useful in situations where performance is critical, as they can be more efficient than lists for certain operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.</br>
